### This document contains information about the criteria used to select teams for this project's first making event:

<br>

These are the initial thoughts:

<br>

- some experience in building hardware (evidence should be shared with links to repositories (GitHub, GitLab), webpages (Thingiverse, Instructables), academic papers)
- Teams from all backgrounds are welcome (academic, non-academic, from within organizations, independent tinkerers, makerspaces, etc.)
- Maybe a min of 3 in the group, with different backgrounds
- Diverse groups will be given strong preference
- Previous collaborating history between members of the group is a plus

- Ability to commit a certain chunk of time per week:
  - For a check in call (30 min), where we can discuss progresses, challenges, and how to help each other
  - To actually work on the project.
 
 <br>


### Applying for the event:
#### note: This application method is based on previous experiences for similar workshops we organized with [TReND in Africa](trendinafrica.org). Other ideas and suggestions are welcome!

#### applications should be sent to: andremaia[at]mozillafoundation.org

<br>

#### Groups applying should be aware that their application will be made available online if they get selected.

- Groups can apply by sending two documents:
  - one page CV per group participant (3 participants in a group = 3 CVs) containing relevant experience in building free and open source hardware
  - one page document per group laying out why they want to be a part of this event and how they could contribute with the movement for free and open source hardware.

After the building period ends, we will take time to evaluate how each project went. As we know most ideas don't execute the way they are thought out. Therefore, our idea of "doing well" is actually seeing proper documentation and logging of activities. Ideally other people from around the world could pick up the projects from where others left off (or in case the project is still going, to join forces and onboard with minimal effort).

### what is expected of each group:
- Work on an open and collaborative way, documenting their projects using Markdown and Git (we will provide guidance in case your group has never worked with Markdown and/or Git. This is not an exclusion criteria!).
- Attend weekly calls to share progress, issues, new ideas and ways to collaborate.
- Dedicate a minimal amount of time per week to work on the project and its documentation. (?suggestion 1/2 day per week?).


### Why apply:
Let us start by thanking you for considering applying to this event! Without your participation, this wouldn't be possible!

Since this is our first attempt at such an event, a lot of things are very experimental and we don't have a lot of resources. However, if you get selected, we will support you with weekly calls to help the development of your selected tool, as well as with funds to buy components (via reimbursement after presentation of purchase receipts).

<br>

If you are part of an institution/group that could work more independently becauase you are already well funded, do get in touch. We would like to develop as many tools as possible, and by supplying some of the funding for your components, you'll be allowing us to bring more underfunded groups into the event.
