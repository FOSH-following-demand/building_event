# building_event
Repository to exchange ideas and hash out documentation for a making event

Document all steps and format of this event in the repo.

Some people have developed something similar to what is proposed on issue #1, so I'll get in touch with them and see if they want to contribute and/or share what they have done.


From issue 1: (these is the initial idea for this)

We managed to get a small extra grant to actually build tools based on the survey results!
The idea right now is:

- Get the results of the survey and elect local communities as "project leads" (10 project leads seem doable).

- setup a time frame to work on (most likely now is May-June 2019)

- each community would be responsible for developing a piece of hardware. They commit to following a documentation template (as well as a repository template) so that other people can easily contribute and onboard

- each community gets a small amount of money for buying supplies and developing their project

- we do weekly check ins with the communities to see how development is going, and to help iron out issues early on

- All communities come together online at the end of the time frame for "show and tell" and to celebrate the efforts.
