### This document contains information about the criteria used to select teams for this project's first making event:

<br>

This are the initial thoughts:

<br>

- some experience in building hardware (evidence should be shared with links to repositories (GitHub, GitLab), webpages (Thingiverse, Instructables), academic papers)
- Teams from all backgrounds are welcome (academic, non-academic, from within organizations, independent tinkerers, makerspaces, etc.)
- Maybe a min of 3 in the group, with different backgrounds
- Diverse groups will be given strong preference
- Previous collaborating history between members of the group is a plus
