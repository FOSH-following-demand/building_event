### This document contains information about the criteria used to select teams for this project's first making event:

<br>

These are the initial thoughts:

<br>

- some experience in building hardware (evidence should be shared with links to repositories (GitHub, GitLab), webpages (Thingiverse, Instructables), academic papers)
- Teams from all backgrounds are welcome (academic, non-academic, from within organizations, independent tinkerers, makerspaces, etc.)
- Maybe a min of 3 in the group, with different backgrounds
- Diverse groups will be given strong preference
- Previous collaborating history between members of the group is a plus

- Ability to commit a certain chunk of time per week:
  - For a check in call (30 min), where we can discuss progresses, challenges, and how to help each other
  - To actually work on the project.
 
 <br>
After the building period ends, we will take time to evaluate how each project went. As we know most ideas don't execute the way they are thought out. Therefore, our idea of "doing well" is actually seeing proper documentation and logging of activities. Ideally other people from around the world could pick up the projects from where others left off (or in case the project is still going, to join forces and onboard with minimal effort).
