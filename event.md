#### This document contains information on the building event to be executed as part of the Mozilla/FreiesWissen fellowships.
<br>

- This event is the second stage of this project, where the first stage was the development of an online survey to understand 
the needs researchers and educators have in terms of laboratory/research equipment.

- With the results of the survey available, we want to engage communities/groups/institutions and individuals that are already
experienced in building OS tools, and support them to build based on the survey.

#### The idea is to elect project leads and setup a two month time window.
 
 - Project leads are groups/institutions and/or individuals responsible for spearheading the development of 
 a certain hardware (whether this is to be created from zero, or adapted from an existing design is to be decided
 by project leads).

#### During this time, where they will be supported in the following way:

- financial support (up to 800 dollars per group) for the purchase of components and tools to build. This will be paid in the
form of reimbursements when participants provide paid invoices. (We know this can be taxing to participants, but it was the way
found to make use of the grant).

- Weekly "check ins" to see how development is going and where we can offer remote support, put them in contact with other 
people/groups that might have gone to similar issues.

- An online closing event where all groups come together for a "show and tell" and to celebrate their efforts.

#### Project leads will commit to following a documentation template (as well as a repository template) 
so that other people can easily contribute and onboard
