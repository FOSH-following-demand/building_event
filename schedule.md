This document outlines what is expected of the projects and an initial schedule for the teams.


---

During the development of the projects we are going to put quite some emphasis into documentation, as a project is only properly open when its documentation allows others to:
- Feel welcome to contribute.
- Understand the current state of affairs in the project and make contributions.
- Replicate what is being developed and adapt it for local needs/wishes.

Moreover, we will be developing scientific tools, which will hopefully reach a state where they can be:
- Calibrated and tested against "traditional tools".
- Published in a peer reviewed journal.

### Schedule

**Week1:**
- setup github repositories
 - in case needed learn the basics of GitHub, using the many tutorials online ([ex1](https://lab.github.com/), [ex2](https://help.github.com/en/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources), [ex3](https://git-scm.com/doc), [ex4](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git)).


- minimum requirements for your repository:
 - Readme.md
   - Write a bit about what you are doing and why
   - Add a "existing projects" section and put all found projects there (see below for more details).
 - Code_of_conduct.md
   - Show collaborators and developers best practice and set boundaries in case things go wrong.
- here are some example repositories dealing with hardware: [actifield](https://github.com/trendinafrica/actifield), [LightM](https://github.com/vektorious/lightM).



- research existing projects - find what is already available, so that you don't reinvent the wheel. Contact developers, maybe they would like to remotely contribute!

- Draft a development plan (are you planning to 3D print the frame?, use modular elements?, make it battery powered?,wifi capabilities?).
- first call with mentor

**Week2:**

- Work on development plan and initial bill of materials
- add to the repository, if not there yet, a license file and a contributing file
- order parts
- log advances and issues on repository
- second call with mentor

**Week3:**
